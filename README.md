- 👋 Hi, I’m @onelev
- 👀 I’m interested in inorganic chemistry and programming and their possible interaction
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis(pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL
- 💞️ I am looking to move from being a "novice" in data analysis to a state in which I can confidently apply my knowledge to solving practical problems
- 📫 Contact me on Telegram @Arishalevina
